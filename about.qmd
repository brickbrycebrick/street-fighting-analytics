Hi, I'm **Bryce Klein** - a data analyst in Fintech based in Boston, Massachusetts. I also TA for Shaw Talebi's [AI course on Maven](https://maven.com/shaw-talebi/ai-builders-bootcamp).

This blog is an attempt to organize my thoughts (mostly around analytics, AI and programming) into something coherent and useful. 

### Why "Street-Fighting Analytics"?

As a physics undergrad I was heavily inspired by Sanjoy Mahajan's [Street Fighting Mathematics](http://streetfightingmath.com/). It's a book about using math to make quick and reasonably intelligent decisions (something I try to do here). If you like math you should check it out.
